# Mapbox Interactivity Roadmap

1. Interactive hover effects for zones and markers.
2. Layer toggles for POIs by category.
3. Custom markers/icons by type (property, project, restaurant, hospital, school, pharmacy, leisure).
4. Data-driven styling with expressions for status and category.
5. Heatmap layer for POI density.
6. Store locator pattern (map + synchronized list panel).
7. Spatial analysis with Turf.js (distance, nearest, containment).
8. Basemap configuration (brand tuning, terrain, contrast).
9. Isochrone and travel-time overlays for decision support.
